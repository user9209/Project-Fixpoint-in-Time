# Project-Fixpoint-in-Time
Fixpoint in Time means, you can proof that your message was not generated in history and not spoofed after creation.


## Message was not created in history

To proof that, you need to insert a value or word, that was not existing and not possible to predict.

Examples:
- Press article or headline
- Bitcoin or other blockchain hash / value

## Message was created at one point in time even it is history

This is more difficult! You have to add a link to a point in time.
Hash, Signature or Link is added in a blockchian or published in a medium, where it is hard to fake an entry.

Example:
- Target-Address or other value of a bitcoin transaction.
- Posted at a public or semi-public medium, e.g. github, twitter, facebook or other, where you as a user are unable to change the timestamp of your own message and the service provider would not manipulate the timestamp.
- Share the information with a group of individuals, so some of them can confirm, that you have provided the message at this point in time. Not the best!
- Do something, that has to be logged by legal reason, e.g. create a bill or make a SEPA transfer. Here is the problem, how to get access to that data, even if this information is stored for legal reason.

## Fixpoint in time

To provide a proof of fixpoint in time you need both proofs. You know or created that message at this point in time and not before (proof did not exist) and also, that you did not create the message later in time (was created in that moment of time, not later).
